IMGCURL is built in Python and therefore the suitable environment has to be
installed on the server and the client. The two subdirectories represent the
two components:

imgcurl - The server
====================

Apart from Python itself you will need two more dependencies installed: A
webserver (we assume Apache2), flash and redis.

It is recommended on a live system to use Python's virtualenvs. On a
Debian/Ubuntu system you can achieve this, using the following commands.

apt-get install apache2 python-virtualenv libapache2-mod-wsgi redis-server
virtualenv NAMEOFENVIRONMENT --no-site-packages
source /path/to/NAMEOFENVIRONMENT/bin/activate
pip install flask redis
deactivate


Create a wsgi-file
------------------

This goes into: /path/to/imgcurl/imgcurl.wsgi

activate_this = '/path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate_this.py'
execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/imgcurl')
from app import app as application


Create an apache2 virtual host
------------------------------

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName YOURDOMAIN.EXT
        ServerAdmin webmaster@local
        WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/imgcurl/imgcurl.wsgi
</VirtualHost>



imgcurl_cmd - The client
========================

Put it into the directory of your preference. You might want to create an alias
for example in .bashrc

alias imgcurl='python /path/to/imgcurl_cmd/imgcurl.py'


settings.py
========================

Copy the settings.py.dist to settings.py in the same directory and change to
your individual settings. In most cases you only have to change the url in the
imgcurl_cmd/settings.py file. Everything else can be left to default in a
standard configuration.
