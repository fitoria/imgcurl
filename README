A dead simple app to store your favorite links in easy to remember urls.

This just redirects to your favorite images or links.

Example.
http://i.fitoria.net/angry-coder will redirect to http://i.imgur.com/sd3tV.gif
http://i.fitoria.net/trololo -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNxygsLGHSQ

Easy to remember and to setup!

Uses Flask and three dead simple views.
Uses Redis and an incomplete "ORM" that I tried to build, I'll fix it later.
Some tests do not pass because of this.

This won't be ultra documented, don't hope much, done just for shits and giggles.
