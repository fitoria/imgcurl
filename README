A dead simple app to store your favorite images links in easy to remember urls.

This just redirects to your favorite images links.

Example.
http://yoururl.com/funnycat will redirect to http://otherdomain.com/images/uploads/2011/cat.jpg

Easy to remember and to setup!

Uses Flask and three dead simple views.
Uses Redis and an incomplete "ORM" that I tried to build, I'll fix it later.
Some tests do not pass because of this.

This won't be ultra documented, don't hope much, done just for shits and giggles.
